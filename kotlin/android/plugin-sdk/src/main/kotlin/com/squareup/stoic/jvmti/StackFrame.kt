 * Analog of https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/jdk/api/jpda/jdi/com/sun/jdi/StackFrame.html
 *
 * This represents a pointer to the Thread's stack frame. When the actual stack frame gets popped
 * this pointer to it becomes invalid, though in practice ART's JVMTI implementation seems pretty
 * good at generating reasonable error messages when you use it after it becomes invalid.
 *
 * The pointer is just the pair of (Thread, frame-height), so if the exact same frame (that is, same
 * method-id, location) then everything will work fine. I'd say it's hacky to depend on that though!
